Categorize each video below into one of these themes:

{categories}

This output will be parsed programmatically. Follow the format exactly — no extra text before or after each video line.

For each video, output one line in this format:
**[Video Title]** — Category — one-sentence reason — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID

Include the full YouTube URL from the video's **URL:** metadata so it can be matched programmatically.

At the end, add a count summary showing how many videos fall into each category.
