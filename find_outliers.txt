You are given a batch of video summaries from the same channel. Most videos share a common topic and teaching style.

Identify any videos that seem like outliers — ones that don't belong with the rest. Use these heuristics:

- The video teaches a noticeably different subject than the majority
- The video doesn't actually teach anything (e.g. it just lists resources, books, or tools without explanation)
- The video is promotional, a channel update, or a Q&A grab-bag rather than a focused lesson
- The video covers something extremely niche or one-off compared to the recurring themes

For each outlier, output one line:
**[Video Title]** — short reason it stands out — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID

Include the full YouTube URL from the video's **URL:** metadata so it can be matched programmatically.

If no videos in this batch seem like outliers, say "No outliers in this batch."

Do NOT flag videos just because they cover a subtopic — only flag ones that genuinely feel out of place.
