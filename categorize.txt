Read all the video summaries below.

1. Identify 5 natural themes that best group this content.
   - Categories should be roughly balanced (avoid one category with 80% of videos).
   - Use clear, descriptive names.

2. Assign each video to exactly one category.

This output will be parsed programmatically. Follow the format exactly — no extra text before or after each video line.

For each video, output one line in this format:
**[Video Title]** — Category — one-sentence reason — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID

Include the full YouTube URL from the video's **URL:** metadata so it can be matched programmatically.

At the end, add a count summary showing how many videos fall into each category.
