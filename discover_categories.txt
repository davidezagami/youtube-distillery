You are given a list of video titles from a single YouTube channel.

Identify between 4 and 8 natural themes that best group these videos — use as many as the content warrants.
- Categories should be roughly balanced (avoid one category with 80% of videos).
- Use clear, descriptive names.

Output each category on its own line, prefixed with "- ". Nothing else.

Example output:
- Category Name One
- Category Name Two
- Category Name Three
